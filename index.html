        A <em style="background-color: #1a89171a">wonderful</em> serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone,<br>
        and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend,<br>
        so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.

        I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. <br>
        When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and <em style="background-color: #1a89171a">the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees,</em> <br>
        and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.
